                <h3>Inspiration around Ocean Invaders:</h3>
                <p>When I was a child, my father and I went to a family friend's house and they had a game called 
                    Space Invaders. My dad found a lot of joy playing this game and I could see that the game had 
                    brought many memories that he is very fond of and brought great joy in his life. Because of this, 
                    I have decided to create a game that has taken inspiration from the game, but has many twists and differences.
                    I will further explain this in the rules page listed above.
